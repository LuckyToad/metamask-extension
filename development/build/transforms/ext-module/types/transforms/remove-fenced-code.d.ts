/**
 * Removes fenced code from the given JavaScript source string. "Fenced code"
 * includes the entire fence lines, including their trailing newlines, and the
 * lines that they surround.
 *
 * A valid fence consists of two well-formed fence lines, separated by one or
 * more lines that should be excluded. The first line must contain a `BEGIN`
 * directive, and the second most contain an `END` directive. Both directives
 * must specify the same command.
 *
 * Here's an example of a valid fence:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *   ///: BEGIN:ONLY_INCLUDE_IF(build-flask)
 *   console.log('I am Flask.');
 *   ///: END:ONLY_INCLUDE_IF
 * ```
 *
 * For details, please see the documentation.

 * @returns A tuple of the post-transform file contents and a boolean indicating
 * whether they were modified.
